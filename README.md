## Built with

+ SQL, PostgreSQL DB

## Getting Started

1. To get this project up and running in your terminal use the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/Yothu/vet-clinic-database.git
```

Then access PostgresSQL. Continue the rest when you are in it.

2. To create the data base use the next command:

```
CREATE DATABASE vet_clinic;
```

3. Connect to the just created database using this:

```
/c vet_clinic
```

4. Create the tables copying and pasting the commands in the [**schema.sql**](https://github.com/Yothu/vet-clinic-database/blob/develop/schema.sql) file.
5. Add the data to the table copying and pasting the commands in the [**data.sql**](https://github.com/Yothu/vet-clinic-database/blob/develop/data.sql) file.
6. Create the queries copying and pasting the commands in the [**queries.sql**](https://github.com/Yothu/vet-clinic-database/blob/develop/queries.sql) file.

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

- Use [schema.sql](./schema.sql) to create all tables.
- Use [data.sql](./data.sql) to populate tables with sample data.
- Check [queries.sql](./queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database. **Important note: this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly!**
